<p>The San Francisco International Airport (SFO), has many many flights in and out of town. <a href="http://www.bart.gov" target="other">BART</a> trains leave from SFO and will takey you to San Francisco. Flights into Oakland (OAK) may be a little cheaper, but you will still need to take a shuttle from the airport to BART to get into the city.</p>

We have reserved a block of rooms at the <a href="http://metrohotelsf.com" target="other">Metro Hotel</a>, 
which is about six blocks from the venue.  Additionally, we recommend looking into either 
<a href="http://www.vrbo.com" target="other">VRBO</a> or 
<a href="http://www.airbnb.com" target="other">Airbnb</a> to find more homey accommodations. 
Neighborhoods near our event include: NoPa (or north of the panhandle), Lower Haight, Upper Haight, Fillmore, 
Castro, or Duboce Triangle.</p>
<p>Hotels are plentiful in the Union Square neighborhood downtown. They are a little further away from the venue however, though a pretty short cab ride away.</p>
<p>For our out-of-town guests, we will be hosting a brunch on Sunday morning to spend 
a little more time with those who travelled from far away. More details on the brunch location and time will 
be posted here as we get closer to the event.</p>
</div>

<!--<div id="venue" class="subsection">
<p>We recommend <em>against</em> bringing a car, since we'd 
like you to raise a glass or two with us, and parking can be very difficult in the residential neighborhood 
of the venue. If you are not staying within walking distance, we suggest taking a cab.</p>

<p>You can walking or cabbing to the party, bike, bus, or cab to the party.
Taxi cabs include: Green Cab 415-626-GREEN; Luxor Cabs 415-282-4141; DeSoto Cab 415-970-1300; or Yellow Cab 415-333-3333.</p>-->
