<p>Several people have asked about our registry. The only gift we'd like is that of your presence. Seriously, we don't need anything. But for those who insist, we've registerd for some local ceramics <a href="http://www.heathceramics.com/heath/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=shopping.giftregistry&do=display&giftregistry_ID=5549" target="other">here</a>. We also like Champagne.

        <div class="section-text"><p>We love San Francisco, which is why we've decided to celebrate here in our adopted home.</p>

<div id="sf" class="subsection active">
<p>The San Francisco International Airport (SFO), has many many flights in and out of town. <a href="http://www.bart.gov" target="other">BART</a> trains leave from SFO and will take you to San Francisco. Flights into Oakland (OAK) may be a little cheaper, but you will still need to take a shuttle from the airport to BART to get into the city.</p>

<p>We have reserved a block of rooms at the <a href="http://metrohotelsf.com" target="other">Metro Hotel</a>, 
which is about six blocks from the venue. Be sure to mention our name when reserving.<p>Additionally, we recommend looking into either 
<a href="http://www.vrbo.com" target="other">VRBO</a> or 
<a href="http://www.airbnb.com" target="other">Airbnb</a> to find more homey accommodations. 
Neighborhoods near our event include: NoPa (or north of the panhandle), Lower Haight, Upper Haight, Fillmore, 
Castro, or Duboce Triangle.</p>
<p>Hotels are plentiful in the Union Square neighborhood downtown. They are a little further away from the venue however.</p>
<p>For our out-of-town guests, we will be hosting something on Friday night so as to spend
a little more time with those who travelled from far away. More details on the location and time will 
be posted here as we get closer to the event.</p>
