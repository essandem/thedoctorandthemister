Cocktails and dancing, with a little ceremonial interlude thrown in.<br>
Black tie optional.<br><br>
<b>Where:</b> 1045 Divisadero Street<br>
 San Francisco, California<br><br>
<b>Time:</b> 7:30pm until the wee hours<br><br>
Please <a href="www.thedoctorandthemister.com/rsvp">RSVP</a> on our site to let us know that you'll join us.<br><br>

<b>Other activities:</b> For our out-of-town guests, we will be hosting a brunch on Sunday morning to spend a little more time with those who travelled from far away. More details on the brunch location and time will be posted here as we get closer to the event.<br><br><br>

We prefer you gift us the pleasure of your attendance, but for those who have asked, we have a registry, listed under Sean-Michael or Samantha, at <a href="http://www.heathceramics.com/heath/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=shopping.giftregistry">Heath Ceramics</a>

             <br><br>We love San Francisco, which is why we've decided to celebrate here in our adopted home.<br><br>

<b>Airport information:</b> SFO, the San Francisco International Airport, has many many flights in and out of town. <a href="www.bart.gov">BART</a> leaves from SFO and will drop you off in San Francisco. Flights into Oakland (OAK) may be a little cheaper, but you will still need to take a shuttle from the airport to BART to get into the city.<br><br>

<b>Hotel information:</b> We have reserved a block of rooms at the <b>Hotel</b>, but we also recommend looking into either <a href="www.vrbo.com">VRBO</a> or <a href="www.airbnb.com">airbnb.com</a> to find more homey accommodations. Neighborhoods near our event include: NOPA (or north of the panhandle), Lower Haight, Upper Haight, Fillmore, Castro, or Duboce Triangle.  <br><br>

We recommend <i>against</i> bringing a car, since we'd like you to raise a glass or two with us, and parking can be a little difficult in the residential neighborhood where we're holding the party.<br><br>

You can walk, bike, bus, or cab to the party. <br>
Taxi cabs include: Green Cab 415-626-GREEN; Luxor Cabs 415-282-4141; DeSoto Cab 415-970-1300; or Yellow Cab 415-333-3333.
